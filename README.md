# Indicium-Blockchain
A simple, local cryptocurrency created with the same mathematical principles as Bitcoin. It is fully functioning, and allows the creation of Wallets, Transactions, and Mining. 

Indicium is based on the Bitcoin protocol and follows much of the same mathematical and computational principles. It follows the same consensus mechanism (i.e. Proof-of-Work), as well as the same method of mining blocks and creating/verifiying transactions. Users have wallets within which they store any Indiciums they own, and these wallets are very similar to the ones used in the Bitcoin protocol.

This cryptocurrency was created with the intent of demonstrating how a decentralized and distributed virtual currency functions and how it is coded. This repository offers a glimpse as to how a blockchain functions, how it can be used, and the implications this presents in the field of economics and finance. Indicium provides a look into the inner workings of a blockchain & cryptocurrency, and serves as a practical implementation of a 'real-world' blockchain.

This repsoitory acts much as the Bitcoin's Standard Reference, however it is significantly smaller and less complex, as well as not intended for commercial or public use/distribution.
